## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/portfolio-app.git
   cd portfolio-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```
VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_service_id
VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_template_id
VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
```

To set up EmailJS:
1. Create an account at [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/)
2. Create a service and template
3. Get your service ID, template ID, and public key
4. Add them to your `.env` file

### Lighthouse Configuration

The project includes a `lighthouserc.json` file that configures Lighthouse CI to ensure high-quality standards for:
- Performance
- Accessibility
- Best Practices
- SEO

Run Lighthouse tests with:
```bash
npm run lighthouse
```

## 🎨 Customization

### Personal Information

Edit the `src/data/portfolioData.ts` file to update:
- Personal details
- Work experience
- Education
- Skills
- Projects
- Achievements
- Contact information

### Theme Customization

The color scheme can be customized in the `portfolioData.ts` file under the `colors` object:

```typescript
colors: {
  primary: "#3B82F6",
  secondary: "#10B981",
  accent: "#F97316",
  // ... other colors
}
```

### Adding New Sections

To add a new section to the portfolio:

1. Create a new component in `src/components/sections/`
2. Add the section to the `App.tsx` file
3. Update the navigation in `Header.tsx`
4. Add the section ID to the `sections` array in the navigation slice

## 🚄 Performance Optimization

The portfolio implements several performance optimizations:

### Code Splitting
- Non-critical sections are lazy-loaded using React's `lazy` and `Suspense`
- This reduces the initial bundle size and improves load time

### Asset Optimization
- Images are properly sized and include width/height attributes to prevent layout shifts
- External resources are preconnected and preloaded where appropriate

### Bundle Optimization
- Vite's build configuration includes chunk splitting for vendor libraries
- Assets are organized into appropriate directories during build

### Monitoring
- Lighthouse CI is configured to ensure performance standards are maintained

## ♿ Accessibility Features

The portfolio is designed with accessibility in mind:

- **Semantic HTML**: Proper heading hierarchy and landmark regions
- **ARIA Attributes**: Used appropriately to enhance screen reader experience
- **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- **Skip Link**: Allows keyboard users to bypass navigation
- **Color Contrast**: Meets WCAG AA standards for readability
- **Focus Management**: Visible focus indicators for keyboard users
- **Responsive Design**: Accessible on all device sizes
- **Screen Reader Announcements**: Proper labeling for all interactive elements

## 🚢 Deployment

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

This will generate optimized production files in the `dist` directory.

### Deployment Options

The portfolio can be deployed to various platforms:

- **Netlify**: Connect your GitHub repository or drag and drop the `dist` folder
- **Vercel**: Connect your GitHub repository for automatic deployments
- **GitHub Pages**: Push the `dist` folder to a `gh-pages` branch
- **AWS S3/CloudFront**: Upload the `dist` folder to an S3 bucket and configure CloudFront

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
